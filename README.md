# ☁️ Cloud Security Automation Pipeline

![Security Pipeline](https://github.com/<YOUR-USER>/<YOUR-REPO>/actions/workflows/security.yml/badge.svg)

## 🧭 Overview
The **Cloud Security Automation Pipeline** is a CI/CD workflow built with **GitHub Actions** to automate vulnerability scanning and strengthen application security.  
It continuously analyzes Python source code and container images using open-source tools to detect risks early in the development lifecycle — aligning with DevSecOps and Cloud Security best practice[...]

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Bandit** — Performs **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** on Python source code to detect insecure code patterns.  
- **Trivy** — Scans for **vulnerabilities (CVEs)** in dependencies, container images, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).  
- **GitHub Actions** — Automates workflow execution, scanning, and report generation in a secure CI/CD pipeline.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. On each **push** or **pull request**, GitHub Actions triggers automated scans.  
2. **Bandit** analyzes all `.py` files for security flaws and risky code.  
3. **Trivy** scans the local filesystem and container images for known CVEs.  
4. Reports are uploaded as **artifacts** in the GitHub Actions interface.

## 📈 Reports
Each workflow run produces the following reports:
- `bandit-report.json` — Static analysis of Python code.
- `trivy-fs-report.json` — Vulnerabilities in dependencies and filesystem.
- `trivy-image-report.json` — CVEs found in container images.

You can download these reports from the **Actions → Artifacts** tab in your GitHub repository.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate **OWASP ZAP** for web application (DAST) scanning.  
- Add **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** configuration scanning.  
- Implement **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates.  
- Add **Gitleaks** for secret scanning and credential detection.  
- Generate combined **HTML reports** for easier visualization.
